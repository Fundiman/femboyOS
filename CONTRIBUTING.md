# CONTRIBUTING TO FEMBOYOS

## before you do anything
- this is a dumpster fire project.
- if you wanna help, cool. if you wanna break it more, also cool.

## coding rules (kinda)
- no huge fancy c++ stuff, just plain c and some asm.
- if you make it worse but funnier, that's a win.
- if you fix something accidentally, also a win.
- make your code readable. at least pretend.
- **tabs**, not spaces. we are not savages.

## how to send stuff
- fork it
- break it
- send a pull request
- maybe it gets merged. maybe not. who knows.

## important
- don't rewrite everything just because you hate how it looks.  
  *i already know it's ugly.*
- if you add a feature, make it stupid simple.
- memes in comments are allowed. encouraged, actually.

## things you can work on (if you’re bored)
- add random commands
- make the cli less trash
- fix network stuff (it’s haunted)
- add broken features
- make the os crash in cooler ways

## special thanks to these legendary folks
- **ploszukiwacz (owner of the project, duh)** – created the whole project
- **Fundiman** – owner of this fork

## license stuff
- by contributing you agree that your code is tossed into this chaotic mess under the same license.
- you’re not getting paid lol.
